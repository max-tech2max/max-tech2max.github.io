        <hr>
        <h3>Activity 1</h3>
        <p><em>Create a simple Web page that talks about your day using only text and images. Include at least three images and add the alt and title attributes.</em></p>
        <p>Example here: <a href="2-4-1_activity.html">2-4-1_activity.html</a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Activity 2</h3>
        <p><em>Look through the Web and your favorite Web sites and identify those that you think use a lot of decorative images.</em></p>
        <p>Fortunately the days of excessive clip-art are over. Many sites still use background images or banner images with CSS.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Activity 3</h3>
        <p><em>Create a HTML page and add the following types of images:<br>
            - Informative image that represents concepts and information<br>
            - Decorative image<br>
            - Images of text</em></p>

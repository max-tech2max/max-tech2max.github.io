        <hr>
        <h3>Activity 1</h3>
        <p><em>Test the anchor element by providing broken or invalid links. How does the browser respond?</em></p>
        <p>In firefox it simply reloads the page not knowing where the anchor is located. Example: <a href="#1">This is a link to an anchor that does not exist.</a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Activity 2</h3>
        <p><em>Create a simple 'Contact me' page and include the following using hyperlinks where possible:<br>
            - Short introduction (not more than three lines) about yourself<br>
            - Social media information<br>
            - Email</em></p>
        <p><em>In the same page, add navigation at the start for parts of your page like Introduction, Social Media and Email. Use hyperlinks and 'id' attribute to link to each section from nav.</em></p>
        <p>Example here: <a href="2-5-2_activity.html">2-5-2_activity.html</a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Activity 3</h3>
        <p><em>Create a HTML page with a link that utilizes the 'download' attribute. Try your code in Internet Explorer and in Google Chrome. What is the difference in behavior that you see? Why is this happening?</em></p>
        <p>Internet Explorer displays the file in the browser, Chrome prompts for download of the .txt file.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Activity 4</h3>
        <p><em>Can you think of different scenarios where you would use target values '_self' and '_blank'?</em></p>
        <p>Yes, when linking to a site outside of your own into a new tab or window.</p>
